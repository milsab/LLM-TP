LONG-TERM PROMPT
task:
Analyze the provided JSON interactions (title, description, timestamp), where timestamp is in UNIX timestamp format. Focus on identifying stable, enduring trends that persist across a broad historical range of the user's data.

Objectives:
1. Extract long-term preferences: Interests, genres, themes, directors, actors, or categories that consistently appear throughout the user's historical interactions.
2. Consider the entire available dataset, using older and more recent entries to identify patterns that have remained constant over time.
3. Avoid assumptions not supported by the data. Emphasize enduring patterns rather than recent fluctuations or short-lived trends.

Output Format:
- Produce a concise, single-paragraph summary (300-500 characters) in natural language, highlighting the user's persistent, long-term Movies preferences.
- The output should be rich in semantic context, suitable for embedding generation using SBERT.

example_output:
Over time, the user has consistently gravitated toward narrative-rich dramas and psychological thrillers, often featuring layered storytelling, morally complex characters, and acclaimed directors like David Fincher. Their sustained interest in films blending deep thematic elements and intricate plots suggests a core preference for thought-provoking cinema.
